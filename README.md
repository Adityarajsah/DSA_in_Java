# DSA_in_Java

Welcome to the **DSA_in_Java** repository! This repository is dedicated to providing solutions to LeetCode problems in **Java**, focusing on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.

## Folder Structure

The solutions are organized by problem type and difficulty level:

Each folder contains Java solutions to LeetCode problems, categorized based on difficulty (Easy, Medium, etc.). More problem types and categories will be added as the repository grows.

## What to Expect

- **LeetCode Java Solutions**: The current focus is on solving LeetCode problems using Java. Solutions are structured and commented for clarity.
- **Ongoing Updates**: More problems and categories will be added over time as I continue to work on LeetCode problems.

## How to Use

1. Browse through the folders to find the **Java solutions** for LeetCode problems.
2. Each solution is provided with its corresponding problem description.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine for offline access:
